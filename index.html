        <p>
          I am a former math teacher of six years. I love math as well as
          technology. I was all about entering formulas into Excel to track
          student data. Now I am learning new tools to help me make a career
          change. I am from Bailey, CO. I grew up playing outdoors with my
          brother and friends. At the time, growing up an hour away from most
          'teen activities' like a movie theater, mall, etc. was difficult.
          Looking back, though, I wouldn't change my hometown location. I am
          very grateful to have been raised in Bailey. I love watching Nuggets
          games, in-person preferrably, but on TV is also exciting. I have a pug
          named Noodle, so playing with her is also fun. I also like to
          scrapbook with my favorite memories of friends and vacations. Of
          course this list wouldn't be compelete without listing that I love
          math; whether it's tutoring or a solving a simple algebraic equation.I
          have a creative side, but also technical. I want to keep users engaged
          in the site they're using, but also help maintain the site's
          efficiency.
